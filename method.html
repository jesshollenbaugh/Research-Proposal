     <h1>Method and Design</h1>
     <p>First I would take a random sample of STEM majors and do a simple survey to see what proportion have had formal music education, past or present. The proportion may vary depending on location, so it would be prudent to either take a large and diverse sample from many different universities or isolate it to one test site, i.e. Portland State University. An open ended survey with multiple questions would be most appropriate--have they received any formal music education? How many years? Is it continuing to this day? Do they also study music in college even though theyâ€™re a STEM major? How would they describe its impact on their overall education? Emotional wellbeing? Social wellbeing? This data would be analyzed and the various different means/proportions calculated. Ideally I would like to follow up with participants who answered favorably and conduct short interviews. I want to know the proportion of students who were impacted positively by music, but also look for themes--whether it improved self confidence, grades, etc. </p?
