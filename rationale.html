      <p>I’m hoping to look at specifically the impact of formal music education on STEM majors. Do musicians find themselves more inclined to study math and science or are STEM students drawn to music? What impact does music have on students of all disciplines outside of the “Mozart effect?” I hypothesize that the social and emotional aspects of music education play a large role in the formation of the greatest minds in science. If playing music makes STEM students more likely to excel in their given field then it isn’t something that can be afforded to downplay or defunded.</p>
