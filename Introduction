<p>Very generally, I am curious about the intersection between music and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), particularly in university students. As a physics major minoring in music, I see that many students participate in ensembles even if they aren’t music majors--and STEM majors seem to be particularly common in music programs. In an era where scientists and engineers are more employable than ever, it’s essential to keep hold of the arts that make us “human,” especially when it serves to benefit analytical skills.</p>
