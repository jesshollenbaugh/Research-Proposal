<p><em>This chapter describes the methodology of the 1996 study “Addressing National Needs for Skilled Technical Graduates.” Though the purpose of the chapter is to inform future researchers on the uses of workplace observation, the work itself is of interest to my project--in looking at the most essential skills in SMET (STEM) workplaces, I can draw parallels to which of these can be strengthened by a music education.</p></em><br>

<p><em>This article describes a brief look into the effects of music exposure on plant growth. This is not explicitly in my area of interest, but it is related--if music can stimulate growth in plants without ears, what must it do for humans?</em></p><br>

<p><em>This story makes a case against high schools cutting funding for music in an attempt to promote math and science education. The researchers find a strong correlation between students playing music and achieving academically, particularly in STEM courses. It is a story that links to the original research paper, which I will investigate.</em></p><br>

<p><em>This study is an in-depth inquiry into the “music makes you smarter” mindset. It explores the perceptions of students, parents, music teachers, and non-music teachers of the phenomenon, and then compares these perceptions with data taken from the same students in question. It finds that “quantitative findings generally indicate that musical study increases general cognitive abilities.”</em></p><br>
